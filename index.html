<p>Most of us have very little to show for past time. If you're effective you usually get some respect 
  from colleagues and the ability to allocate some amount of society's resources. Looking back, I wish 
  I had written more so plan to do more of this going forward. I am sharing this because public scrutiny 
  leads to more organized thought. </p>
